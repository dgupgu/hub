Guy walks up to a coke machine wearin ga park and puts in a dollar, finds out it costs more than he has so he hits coin return and gets 10x the amount he put in. Immediately puts the 20 in the machine and returns that to get another 10x. Continues doing this until he eventually puts 6000 in the machine, hits the coin return button and then the power goes out across the city. When it comes back on the machine shows nil, he hits the return button a few time but instead of getting money back he gets a single coke.", "Guy walks up to a machine in a city.", "He puts a dollar in and then sees that it costs more than he has on him.", "He hits coin return and gets 10x back.", "He puts that twenty in the machine.", "When he coin returns that he gets 10x back again.", "Instead of being content he continues to put more and more money into the machine until he's put everything he has in it.", "When he tries to return it the power in the city goes out for a moment and when it comes back the machine says the balance is zero.", "When he hits coin return he gets a coke back and thats it.", ""
